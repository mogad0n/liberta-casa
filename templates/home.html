of various topics under the umbrella of Science, Philosophy, Politics etc and a general place to hang back and idle away.

type /list for more channels.



Account registration FAQ
========================

1. How do I register my nickname / account?

Use this command, substituting your desired password and e-mail address:

/msg NickServ register mySecretPassword

You can also register on this page <a href="{{ url_for('register')}}">here</a>

Once you register your nick it becomes your account name. It is the name with which you are expected to login.


2. How do I authenticate to my nickname?

You should enable SASL in your client. For clients like Hexchat the Username field needs to be populated with the name that you registered.


If your client doesn't support SASL, there are potential workarounds;
you may be able to script your client to authenticate to NickServ
automatically, with `/msg NickServ identify nickname password`.

Ask in #help for support with this.

3. What are the benefits of registering my nickname?

The primary benefit of nickname registration is that the server can act
as an "IRC bouncer" on your behalf. Specifically:

  a. No one else will be able to use your nickname
  b. If all your clients are configured to use SASL, they can all use the same
     nickname (as though they were connected to the same ZNC instance)
  c. Optionally, the server can keep you present on the server even if
     you have no connected clients. To enable this, use the following command:
     `/msg NickServ set always-on true`
  d. You will be able to receive history playback (see below).

You can also request a vhost (i.e., a fake hostname that will be displayed
in place of your cloaked IP-based hostname), using the command
`/msg HostServ request desired.vhost`. An operator will review this request
(and most likely grant it).


4. History Playback.

typing the command /quote History #channel 1h will give you 1hr of history playback for that channel.
